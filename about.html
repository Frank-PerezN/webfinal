    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Frank Perez, the creator of this website. I am currently about to start my second year of CPP at Seneca.  Welcome to my digital showcase of Toronto's hidden gems!</p>
    <p>I have a passion for exploring and discovering unique places, and I wanted to share my findings with fellow adventurers. Toronto is a city full of surprises, and my goal is to help you uncover awesome places that this vibrant city has to offer.</p>
    <p>This website was created as part of the WEB222 course project. I took inspiration from various sources, including online travel blogs, local guides, and my own experiences. The design and content were carefully curated to provide an enjoyable and informative browsing experience.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my website and joining me on this virtual journey through Toronto's hidden treasures!</p>
